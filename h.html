        <h3>Do not steal/grief, even if unclaimed.</h3>
        <p>Do not take stuff you don't own without the consent of the owner, even if it looks abandoned/unclaimed. Breaking this rule will get you a permaban.</p>
    </li><br>

    <li>
        <h3>Be nice to the others.</h3>
        <p>Staff reserves the right to punish this on a case by case basis given the subjective nature of such a rule.</p>
        <p>Due to too much player incivilities, if a staff member catch you leaving intentionally items on the ground, you'll be temporarily banned for 7 days on all the officials. Items on the ground are laggy, if you want to get rid of it, use a fire/lava/trash or any way to destruct items instead of throwing them on the ground.</p>
    </li><br>

    <li>
        <h3>Do not lag the server on purpose!</h3>
        <p>If you think yours or someone else's base is laggy, ask a member of staff to audit it.</p>
        <p>If a staff ask you to modify or remove your setup, you must comply, or the staff reserves the right to remove the laggy setup WITHOUT REFUND. In extreme cases bases my be altered without warning but we will leave a sign notifying the user of what happened.</p>
    </li><br>

    <li>
        <h3>PvP is not allowed!</h3>
        <p>So unless you have the consent of the others, it's forbidden and will be punished! this includes Witchery abuse (cursing, giving vampirism or lycanthropy, etc).</p>
    </li><br>

    <li>
        <h3>No hacked clients.</h3>
        <p>No external mods that give you an advantage over other players (This includes x-ray). If you wish to cheat, go to single player.</p>
    </li><br>

    <li>
        <h3>No duping.</h3>
        <p>This severely disrupts the servers economy and will be heavily punished.</p>
    </li><br>

    <li>
        <h3>Things to avoid (This is subject to change as more items are discovered)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not play with an unclaimed base/base with explosion flag set to false. <b>No rollback if your base blow up in that case.</b></li>
            <li>Do not upgrade your backpack from the "Backpack" mod if it's not empty, otherwise you'll lose your stuff.</li>
            <li>Do not move AE cells in bulk (inventory or dolly) it will corrupt your playerprofile.</li>
            <li><b><u>Use fluid AE at your very own risk! it's known to be laggy, and lag-free alternatives do exist. If lag from fluid AE is observed, operators will ask you to remove your fluid AE setups.</u></b></li>
            <li>Do not nest dollies, compressed chests or generally any NBT heavy items. This will corrupt the chunk and require a reset/rollback.</li>
            <li>Encase your nuclear reactor properly, no rollbacks will be provided for user ignorance.</li>
            <li>Avoid the usage of the Rockets to reach the planets you can run into troubles, use the stargate at spawn instead.</li>
            <li>Do not try to force load a chunk. This causes other players experiences to be degraded and is heavily punished.</li>
            <li>List of stuff that works as admin anchor:
                <ul>
                    <li>Chunkloader upgrade (from opencomputers)</li>
                    <li>Ender Quarry (it's usage is tolerated as long as you don't unpower it on purpose to force the chunkloading of an area)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Do not place anchors in other users bases in order to load their base when they are not online. This is considered bypassing the intended functionality of passive anchors and is greatly unfair to other users.</li>
            <li>Make sure to avoid fast input/output if you use ExtraCells. This is a known laggy mod and staff heavily recommend against its use, you have been warned.</li>
            <li>Sometimes vanilla like furnaces can lag if there are items to process/processed in it, so try to process them without letting leftover in it.</li>
            <li><b><i><u>Avoid leaving items on the ground, especially if you chunkload a farm.</u></i></b></li>
            <li>Try to claim your base as soon as possible, this avoids mobs getting stuck in caves and causing lag. (If you need a mob farm you can use /mytown plot to designate an area)</li>
            <li>Cows/pigs/horses/chickens/sheep/pets are limited to 5 of each per base, villagers are limited to 10 per base to avoid lag (AI for the mobs can be CPU intensive)</li>
            <li>Do not use the charm of Keeping, it's bugged, use the Soulbound I enchantment instead.</li>
            <li>Do not place a motion sensor from OpenComputer in the world, it will crash the server.</li>
            <li>Do not use the teleposer to telepose anything that is not a normal block, as it can crash the servers and corrupt the machines you telepose.</li>
            <li><b>DO NOT use storage buses on drawer controllers, and in general avoid drawer controllers, it's very laggy</b></li><br>
    <b><i>No refunds will be given for the above list.</b></i>
        </ul>
